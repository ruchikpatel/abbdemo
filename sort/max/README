So I actually messed up a bit, I over read the requirement for the project and hence I didn’t included the new test case “where n random values are timed for various values of n” in a separate file. However since it was just a loop I included it in the “maxSubArray_random.py” itself. So to run the program it’s just the same usual steps, running the bash file. I hope that’s not too much of a trouble. I apologize for the confusion caused, I will try my best to not repeat the same kind of mistake.
